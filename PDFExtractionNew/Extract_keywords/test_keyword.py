text = "From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return For many, the toughest leadership test is now looming: how to bring a business back in an environment where a vaccine has yet to be found and economies are still reeling. by Kevin Sneader and Bob Sternfels May 2020 © Maskot/Getty Images The 1966 World Cup marked a low point for Brazilian soccer. Although the winner of the previous two tournaments, the team was eliminated in the first round, and its star player, Pelé, failed to perform. Fouled frequently and flagrantly, he threatened never to return to the World Cup. Many wondered if Brazil’s glory days were over. Four years later, however, Brazil won again, with such grace and style that the 1970 team is not only widely regarded as the best team ever to take the pitch but also as the most beautiful. And Pelé was named the player of the tournament. Making this turnaround required innovation, in particular, the creation of a unique attacking style of soccer. It required building a cohesive team, even as most of the roster changed. And it required leadership, both in management and on the field. The result: by reimagining everything, Brazil came back stronger. As businesses around the world consider how they can return from the torment inflicted by the coronavirus, Brazil’s journey from failure to triumph provides food for thought. In a previous article, McKinsey described five qualities that will be critical for business leaders to find their way to the next normal: resolve, resilience, return, reimagination, and reform. We noted that there would likely be overlap among these stages, and the order might differ, depending on the business, the sector, and the country. In this article, we suggest that in order to come back stronger, companies should reimagine their business model as they return to full speed. The moment is not to be lost: those who step up their game will be better off and far more ready to confront the challenges—and opportunities—of the next normal than those who do not. There are four strategic areas to focus on: recovering revenue, rebuilding operations, rethinking the organization, and accelerating the adoption of digital solutions. 1.Rapidly recover revenue. Speed matters: it will not be enough for companies to recover revenues gradually as the crisis abates. They will need to fundamentally rethink their revenue profile, to position themselves for the long term and to get ahead of the competition. To do this companies must SHAPE up. Start-up mindset. This favors action over research, and testing over analysis. Establish a brisk cadence to encourage agility and accountability: daily team check-ins, weekly 30-minute CEO reviews, and twice-a-month 60-minute reviews. Human at the core. Companies will need to rethink their operating model based on how their people work best. Sixty percent of businesses surveyed by McKinsey in early April said that their new remote sales models were proving as much (29 percent) or more effective (31 percent) than traditional channels. Acceleration of digital, tech, and analytics. It’s already a cliché: the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the shift to digital. But the best companies are going further, by enhancing and expanding their digital channels. They’re successfully using advanced analytics to combine new sources of data, such as satellite imaging, with their own insights to make better and faster decisions and strengthen their links to customers. Purpose-driven customer playbook. Companies need to understand what customers will value, post-COVID-19, and develop new use cases and tailored experiences based on those insights. Ecosystems and adaptability. Given crisis- related disruptions in supply chains and channels, adaptability is essential. That will mean changing the ecosystem and considering nontraditional collaborations with partners up and down the supply chain. 2 From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return Rapid revenue response isn’t just a way to survive the crisis. It’s the next normal for how companies will have to operate. Assuming company leaders are in good SHAPE, how do they go about choosing what to do? We see three steps. Identify and prioritize revenue opportunities. What’s important is to identify the primary sources of revenue and, on that basis, make the “now or never” moves that need to happen before the recovery fully starts. This may include launching targeted campaigns to win back loyal customers; developing customer experiences focused on GES 2020 increased health and safety; adjusting pricing COVID Reimagining Return and promotions based on new data; reallocating Exhibit 1 of 1 spending to proven growth sources; reskilling the sales force to support remote selling; creating flexible payment terms; digitizing sales channels; and automating processes to free up sales representatives to sell more. Once identified, these measures need to be rigorously prioritized to reflect their impact on earnings and the company’s ability to execute quickly (exhibit). Act with urgency. During the current crisis, businesses have worked faster and better than they dreamed possible just a few months ago. Maintaining that sense of possibility will be an enduring source of competitive advantage. Consider a Chinese car-rental company whose revenues fell 95 percent in February. With the roads Exhibit Recovering revenues is an important element of reimagining the return.

Maintaining that sense of possibility will be an enduring source of competitive advantage. empty, company leaders didn’t just stew. Instead, they reacted like a start-up. They invested in micro–customer segmentation and social listening to guide personalization. This led them to develop new use cases. They discovered, for example, that many tech firms were telling employees not to use public transportation. The car-rental company used this insight to experiment with and refine targeted campaigns. They also called first-time customers who had cancelled orders to reassure them of the various safety steps the company had taken, such as “no touch” car pickup. To manage the program, they pulled together three agile teams with cross- functional skills and designed a recovery dashboard to track progress. Before the crisis, the company took up to three weeks to launch a campaign; that is now down to two to three days. Within seven weeks, the company had recovered 90 percent of its business, year on year—almost twice the rate of its chief competitor. Develop an agile operating model. Driven by urgency, marketing and sales leaders are increasingly willing to embrace agile methods; they are getting used to jumping on quick videoconferences to solve problems and give remote teams more decision- making authority. It’s also important, of course, for cross-functional teams not to lose sight of the long term and to avoid panic reactions. In this sense, “agile” means putting in place a new operating model built around the customer and supported by the right processes and governance. Agile sales organizations, for example, continuously prioritize accounts and deals, and decide quickly where to invest. But this is effective only if there is a clear growth plan that sets out how to win each type of customer. Similarly, fast decision making between local sales and global business units and the rapid reallocation of resources between them require a stable sales-pipeline-management process. 2. Rebuilding operations. The coronavirus pandemic has radically changed demand patterns for products and services across sectors, while exposing points of fragility in global supply chains and service networks. At the same time, it has been striking how fast many companies have adapted, creating radical new levels of visibility, agility, productivity, and end- customer connectivity. Now leaders are asking themselves: How can we sustain this performance? As operations leaders seek to reinvent the way they work and thus position themselves for the next normal, five themes are emerging. Building operations resilience. Successful companies will redesign their operations and supply chains to protect against a wider and more acute range of potential shocks. In addition, they will act quickly to rebalance their global asset base and supplier mix. The once-prevalent global-sourcing model in product-driven value chains has steadily 4 From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return declined as new technologies and consumer- demand patterns encourage regionalization of supply chains. We expect this trend to accelerate. This reinvention and regionalization of global value chains is also likely to accelerate adoption of other levers to strengthen operational resilience, including increased use of external suppliers to supplement internal operations, greater workforce cross-training, and dual or even triple sourcing. Accelerating end-to-end value-chain digitization. Creating this new level of operations resilience could be expensive, in both time and resources. The good news, however, is that leading innovators have demonstrated how “Industry 4.0” (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution suite of digital and analytics tools and approaches) can significantly reduce the cost of flexibility. In short, low-cost, high- flexibility operations are not only possible—they are happening. Most companies were already digitizing their operations before the coronavirus hit. If they accelerate these efforts now, they will likely see significant benefits in productivity, flexibility, quality, and end-customer connectivity. Rapidly increasing capital- and operating-expense transparency. To survive and thrive amid the economic fallout, companies can build their next- normal operations around a revamped approach to spending. A full suite of technology-enabled methodologies is accelerating cost transparency, compressing months of effort into weeks or days. These digital approaches include procurement- spend analysis and clean-sheeting, end-to- end inventory rebalancing, and capital-spend diagnostics and portfolio rationalization. Companies are also seeking to turn fixed capital costs into variable ones by leveraging “as a service” models. Embracing the future of work. The future of work, defined by the use of more automation and technology, was always coming. COVID-19 has hastened the pace. Employees across all functions, for example, have learned how to complete tasks remotely, using digital communication and collaboration tools. In operations, changes will go further, with an accelerated decline in manual and repetitive tasks and a rise in the need for analytical and technical support. This shift will call for substantial investment in workforce engagement and training in new skills, much of it delivered using digital tools. Reimagining a sustainable operations competitive advantage. Dramatic shifts in industry structure, customer expectations, and demand patterns create a need for equally dramatic shifts in operations strategies to create competitive advantage and new customer value propositions. Successful companies will reinvent the role of operations in their enterprises, creating new value through a far greater responsiveness to their end customers—including but not limited to accelerated product-development and customer- experience innovation, mass customization, improved environmental sustainability, and more interconnected, nimble ecosystem management. Taking action. To keep up during COVID-19, companies have moved fast. Sales and operation planning used to be done weekly or even monthly; now a daily cadence is common. To build on this progress, speed will continue to be of the essence. Companies that recognize this, and that are willing to set new standards and upend old paradigms, will build long-term strategic advantage. 3. Rethinking the organization. In 2019, a leading retailer was exploring how to launch a curbside-delivery business; the plan stretched over 18 months. When the COVID-19 lockdown hit the United States, it went live in two days. There are many more examples of this kind. “How can we ever tell ourselves that we can’t be faster?” one executive of a consumer company recently asked. Call it the “great unfreezing”: in the heat of the coronavirus crisis, organizations have been forced to work in new ways, and they are responding. Much of this progress comes from shifts in operating models. Clear goals, focused teams, and rapid decision making have replaced corporate bureaucracy. Now, as the world begins to move into the post-COVID-19 5 From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return era, leaders must commit to not going back. The way in which they rethink their organizations will go a long way in determining their long-term competitive advantage. Specifically, they must decide who they are, how to work, and how to grow. Who we are. In a crisis, what matters becomes very clear, very fast. Strategy, roles, personal ownership, external orientation, and leadership that is both supportive and demanding—all can be seen much more clearly now. The social contract between the employee and employer is, we believe, changing fundamentally. “It will matter whether you actually acted to put the safety of employees and communities first,” one CEO told us, “or just said you cared.” One noticeable characteristic of companies that have adapted well is that they have a strong sense of identity. Leaders and employees have a shared sense of purpose and a common performance culture; they know what the company stands for, beyond shareholder value, and how to get things done right. a dynamic network of teams is more effective. They are rewiring their circuits to make decisions faster, and with much less data and certainty than before. In a world where fast beats slow, companies that can institutionalize these forms of speedy and effective decentralization will jump ahead of the competition. Organizations are also showing a more profound appreciation for matching the right talent, regardless of hierarchy, to the most critical challenges. In an environment with strong cost pressures, successful leaders will see the value in continuing to simplify and streamline their organizational structures. Experience has shown a better way, with critical roles linked to value- creation opportunities and leadership roles that are much more fluid, with new leaders emerging from unexpected places: the premium is placed on character and results, rather than on expertise or experience. This can only work, however, if the talent is there. To hire and keep top talent, the scarcest capital of all, means creating a unique work experience and committing to a renewed emphasis on talent development. How we work. Many leaders are reflecting on how small, nimble teams built in a hurry to deal with the COVID-19 emergency made important decisions faster and better. What companies have learned cannot be unlearned—namely, that a flatter organization that delegates decision making down to How to grow. Coming out of the crisis, organizations must answer important questions about growth and scalability. Three factors will matter most: the ability to embed data and analytics in decision making; the creation of learning platforms that support both individual and institutional experimentation Many leaders are reflecting on how small, nimble teams built in a hurry to deal with the COVID-19 emergency made important decisions faster and better. 6 From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return and learning at scale; and the cultivation of an organizational culture that fosters value creation with other partners. Those organizations that are making the shift from closed systems and one-to-one transactional relationships to digital platforms and networks of mutually beneficial partnerships have proved more resilient during the crisis. “Every business is now a technology business, and what matters most is a deep understanding of the customer, which is enabled by technology,” remarked a retail CEO. By organizing to encourage insight generation—for example, by linking previously unconnected goods and services—technology is revolutionizing how organizations relate to their customers and their customers’ customers. Creating digitally enabled ecosystems is therefore critical because these catalyze growth and enable rapid adaptation. When the crisis hit, one company moved all its full-time direct employees into a virtual operating environment; meanwhile, its outsourcing partner, the CEO recalled, “hid behind their contract and played one customer off against another.” It is not difficult to imagine who is better placed to succeed in the more flexible post-COVID-19 business environment, where value creation is shared and strategic partnerships matter even more. 4. Accelerate digital adoption to enable reimagination. Over the past few months, there has been a transformation in the way we interact with loved ones,  do our work, travel, get medical care, spend leisure time, and conduct many of the routine transactions of life. These changes have accelerated the migration to digital technologies at stunning scale and speed, across every sector. “We are witnessing what will surely be remembered as a historic deployment of remote work and digital access to services across every domain,” remarked one tech CEO.  He is right. Through the COVID-19 recovery, too, digital will play a defining role. During the early recovery period of partial reopening, business leaders will face some fundamental challenges. One is that consumer behavior and demand patterns have changed significantly and will continue to do so. Another is that how the economy lurches back to life will differ from country to country and even city to city. For example, consumers may feel comfortable going to restaurants before they will consider getting on a plane or going to sporting events. Early signals of increased consumer demand will likely come suddenly, and in clusters. Analyzing these demand signals in real time and adapting quickly to bring supply chains and services back will be essential for companies to successfully navigate the recovery. To address these challenges, leaders will need to set an ambitious digital agenda—and deliver it quickly, on the order of two to three months, as opposed to the previous norm of a year or more. There are four elements to this agenda: Refocus digital efforts to reflect changing customer expectations. To adapt, companies need to quickly rethink customer journeys and accelerate the development of digital solutions. The emphasis will be different for each sector. For many retailers, this includes creating a seamless e-commerce experience, enabling customers to complete everything they need to do online, from initial research and purchase to service and returns. For auto companies, this could mean establishing new digital distribution models to handle trade-ins, financing, servicing, and home delivery of cars. For industries such as airlines, ensuring health and safety will be essential, for example, by reinventing the passenger experience with “contactless” check- in, boarding, and in-flight experiences. Use data, Internet of Things, and AI to better manage operations. In parallel, companies need to incorporate new data and create new models to enable real-time decision making. In the same way that many risk and financial models had to be rebuilt after the 2008 financial crisis, the use of 7 From surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return data and analytics will need to be recalibrated to reflect the post-COVID-19 reality. This will involve rapidly validating models, creating new data sets, and enhancing modeling techniques. Getting this right will enable companies to successfully navigate demand forecasting, asset management, and coping with massive new volumes. For example, one airline developed a new app to manage and maintain its idle fleet and support bringing it back into service; and a North American telecommunications company developed a digital collection model for customers facing hardship. Accelerate tech modernization. Companies will also need to greatly improve their IT productivity to lower their cost base and fund rapid, flexible digital- solution development. First, this requires quickly reducing IT costs and making them variable wherever possible to match demand. This means figuring out what costs are flexible in the near-to-medium term, for example, by evaluating nonessential costs related to projects or maintenance, and reallocating resources. Second, this involves defining a future IT-product platform, establishing the skills and roles needed to sustain it, mapping these skills onto the new organization model, and developing leaders who can train people to fill the new or adapted roles. Third, the adoption of cloud and automation technologies will need to be speeded up, including bringing cloud operations on-premise and decommissioning legacy infrastructure. Increase the speed and productivity of digital solutions. To deal with the crisis and its aftermath, companies not only need to develop digital solutions quickly but also to adapt their organizations to new operating models and deliver these solutions to customers and employees at scale. Solving this “last mile” challenge requires integrating businesses processes, incorporating data-driven decision making, and implementing change management. There are different ways to do this. A wide variety of companies, from banks to mining operations, have accelerated delivery by establishing an internal “digital factory” with cross- functional teams dedicated to matching business priorities to digital practices. Others, in addition to reinventing their core businesses, have established new business–building entities to capture new opportunities quickly. For companies around the world, the qualities that brought Brazilian football to new heights in 1970— imagination, leadership, and on-the field execution— will be paramount as they consider how to navigate the post-COVID-19 environment. Business as usual will not be nearly enough: the game has changed too much. But by reimagining how they recover, operate, organize, and use technology, even as they return to work, companies can set the foundations for enduring success.

As spring turned to summer, many US regions started to reopen, as did others in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Despite ongoing public-health concerns, the desire to spend and shop is palpable. Some Asian countries, such as China, have kept incremental cases low, and are restarting economies. Others, such as India, have experienced a steady rise in new cases since reopening. In the past month, another group of countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have lifted and then reinstituted public health measures due to a virus resurgence. How the situation may evolve As different geographies reopen, uncertainties around case reduction might persist. Both the WHO and CDC indicate the possibility of a COVID-19 resurgence in the fall, coinciding with flu season. For the private sector, there are 4 key trends that may continue to shift for the next 18-24 months that need to be considered: 1. customer sentiments and preferences have shifted online due to the pandemic, and may continue to shift; 2. workplace norms have temporarily become remote, with several tech giants entertaining a permanent shift to an altered workforce; 3. the deployment of massive government stimulus packages and the rise of trade tensions contributes to regulatory uncertainty that could persist for a few years 4. our knowledge of how to test, trace, and treat the virus across different public health realities is changing each day with no silver bullet. Actions that institutions can take Given the constantly shifting landscape and uncertainty ahead, thinking about return as a static plan could be ineffective. What’s needed is a return “muscle”: an enterprise-wide ability to absorb uncertainty and incorporate lessons into the operating model quickly. Companies and governments looking to adapt should develop lasting capabilities that comprise this muscle: harnessing the speed and discipline exhibited during the crisis, building capabilities for the ‘next normal’ at scale within your organization, and monitoring / learning from the environment to bound-uncertainty faster than ever before.

Source: McKinsey analysis McKinsey & Company 18 Key uncertainties that will likely drive medium-term scenarios As of May 31, 2020 Focus of the document – 5 potential uncertainties 1. True number of cases to date The true number of cases is only partly unknown due to asymptomatic or otherwise undetected cases. High quality seroprevalence studies are forthcoming, which will help answer this question 2. Pathways to herd immunity Uncertainty remains regarding whether antibody presence equates to immunity, and how long this immunity to COVID-19 lasts 3. Seasonality of transmission While some studies show a modest decrease in transmissibility of COVID-19 during warmer, more humid months1, seasonality does not currently appear to significantly contribute to stopping the spread 4. Effectiveness and implementation of public health interventions over the medium-term The medium-term effect of public health measures, as well as the ability to implement and maintain these measures in specific geographies, are not yet fully understood 5. Adherence to public health measures We are still learning how people’s adherence to public health interventions changes over time, which can affect the effectiveness of these interventions Other uncertainties • Severity of illness • Fatality rate and drivers of mortality • Long term or secondary complications • Mutagenicity • Transmissibility in sub-population, especially children Infection intervals such as latent and infectious periods • • Asymptomatic / pre-symptomatic impact on overall spread • Medium of transmission (e.g., air, surfaces) • Exposure risk factors (e.g., age, occupation) • Mobility and movement patterns during outbreaks and mitigation periods • Population density characteristics 1.

It is also generating entirely new patterns of behavior. Switching for instance has accelerated. In a world of lower overall consumption, access to the digital consumer dollar is shaping the new resilients An altered workforce Remote work is the new norm. Some are thrilled about productivity and flexibility, and the time reclaimed from commutes. Others cannot wait to get back to the office. Up to one-third of jobs in US– 86% of them low income - may be vulnerable2. Strangely, with so many sidelined, some industries are experiencing shortages. Many people cannot return to their jobs because of health-related issues, and newly needed skill sets are in short supply Regulatory uncertainty Before COVID-19, the world was facing growing statist sentiments as well as declining support in the free- market’s ability to distribute wealth. As governments around the world sign up huge COVID-19 stimulus packages (~3x compared to 2008 financial crisis among G20 countries3), new regulations favoring local economies are increasingly likely. This uncertainty can lead to new complexities in government relationships, supply chain, pricing economics and consumer behaviors. Understanding of the virus Around the globe, communities are reopening amidst different public health realities (e.g., stage of crisis, level of virus containment, levels of testing and tracing). On top of that, our understanding of the virus continues to shift, with new studies on testing, transmission and treatment arising each day (e.g., ~171 vaccine candidates in development4). This changing landscape with idiosyncratic considerations by region results in a constantly changing set of safety interventions to protect customers, employees, and citizens at large. 1.

Apply these lessons to future disruptions Act like a small company to have a big impact Protect learning budgets Emulate smaller companies that are more agile, find it easier to change and are often more willing to take risks. They have a clear view of their deficiencies to help prioritize reskilling Invest in skill building to adapt to the next normal. Cutting learning budgets only delays the investment in learning to a later day. E.g., a drop in training expenditures in 2009 and 2010 was followed by a surge in 20111 1. According to the Training Industry Report, US data during and after the Great Recession Source: “To emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, companies should start reskilling their workforces now”, McKinsey.com Organizations that had already tried reskilling felt more prepared to take on future skill gaps than those that hadn’t.

Although it is unlikely to be a panacea – certain tasks will still benefit from in-person connection Negotiations Relationship building Onboarding and job training Critical decision meetings Critical conversations Description Negotiations rely on deep mutual trust and require interpretation of non-verbal communication to react sensitively to the counterpart to achieve the best mutually beneficial outcome Relationship building (e.g., boards, potential customers, interviews, team kick-offs) done in person enable a faster and more trust based connection, as physical human interaction (e.g., shaking hands) plays a major subconscious role in that Training new hires with no previous experience in respective role presents a significant challenge in a remote setting as regular feedback and interaction with a trainer/supervisor is beneficial to optimize learning and train new behaviors Decision meetings in boards are often based on a deep mutual knowledge of board members, where implicit signals have elevated importance (e.g., reading body language of people in the room): thus it is harder to make consensual decisions remotely Critical conversations require a sensitive reaction on emotional and unconscious expressions of one’s counterpart (e.g., body language, facial expressions), which is hindered in a remote setting Furthermore a remote conversation might be perceived as less appreciative 1.Schroeder, Juliana and Risen, Jane and Gino, Francesca and Norton, Michael I., Handshaking Promotes Cooperative Dealmaking (May 29, 2014). 2.Forbes Insights: The case for Face-to-face 3.www.gitlab.com 4.Silent messages Paperback – 1971 by Albert Mehrabia 5.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/sunday-review/zoom-video-conference.html - Why zoom is terrible Examples An experiment done by researchers at the University of Chicago and Harvard found that negotiators who shook hands were more open and honest, and reached better outcomes1 8 out of 10 executives surveyed preferred face to face meetings, with three main reasons:2  Build stronger, more meaningful business relationships (85%)  Ability to read body language and facial expressions (77%)  More social interaction, ability to bond with co-workers/clients Gitlab the world’s largest only remote company does not hire junior roles and so far only has a pilot for interns3 According to research the degree of liking conveyed by facial expressions will dominate and determine the impact of the total message4 which might deteriorate in video calls5 McKinsey & Company 74 The shift to hybrid-virtual model requires considering the needs of employee segments, teams and organization as a whole What are the virtual work archetypes at an employee segment level?

text = """M&A Practice, Consumer Goods Practice The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A Lessons from the global financial crisis teach us that consumer goods companies should consider an active approach to M&A, adapted to the current context, to emerge stronger in the next normal This article was a collaborative, global effort by Harris Atmar, Sara Hudson, Anish Koshy, Stefan Rickert and Rodrigo Slelatt June 2020 © d3sign/Getty Images COVID-19 poses staggering health and humanitarian challenges  (link here). In this rapidly evolving crisis, companies must act on multiple fronts to protect their employees, customers, supply chains, and financial results. All consumer sectors will feel the economic impact of COVID-19. This impact is likely to reshape short- and long-term M&A activity, as investors and organizations explore the implications and reassess how best to shape their business and deploy and/or shore up capital. To understand how Consumer Goods M&A may evolve, we draw on lessons from the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009 and explore the impact of trends in the consumer sector that COVID-19 has created, accelerated, or reversed. Exhibit 1 M&A in the consumer goods sector before COVID-19 While recognizing the meaningful differences between today’s COVID-19 crisis and the GFC, we see lessons from the GFC worth considering today. Analysis of the GFC has shown that companies can drive value creation through M&A during downturns by pursuing active M&A programs (Exhibit 1). Similarly, private equity funds that were more acquisitive during the GFC outperformed their less acquisitive peers.1 1 Preqin Fund Data, https://www.preqin.com/insights/2020. 2 0246810The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A All consumer sectors will feel the economic impact of COVID-19. We evaluated Consumer Goods M&A activity from 2013-2018 in “The next wave of consumer M&A: executing for value,” which took an “archetype” view of deal activity during that five year period. We identified the three most common consumer goods deal archetypes, based on a review of 1,040 acquisitions completed by 119 companies between 2013 and 2018 (Exhibit 2). Our analysis found that companies focused on “snapping up challengers” achieved the highest median TSR (6.3 percent), while companies that “bet on adjacencies” had the lowest (0.4 percent), and companies that sought to “expand the portfolio” landed in the middle (3.3 percent). This was particularly true for those companies that took a programmatic approach  to challenger acquisitions (that is, companies that did Exhibit 2 ≥1–2 small to medium deals per year and primarily participated in “challenger deal” archetypes). Their corporate performance exceeded the industry substantially with 8.3 percent TSR. Several trends that emerged during the GFC (such as shifting to value brands and channels) and after it (such as the explosion of small and challenger brands) influenced consumer goods companies’ strategies for the future. Similarly, we believe COVID-19’s impact on consumer sector trends, seen in our recent article, “How consumer goods companies can prepare for the next normal,”  will help inform how these M&A archetypes will evolve. 3 The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A Impact of COVID-19 on consumer sector trends and implications for Consumer Goods M&A COVID-19 has accelerated existing trends and created new realities that will affect the frequency of M&A activity and the types of deals in the sector. Heightened consumer awareness of health and wellness is reinforcing the trend toward healthier foods and lifestyles. This should continue to pique interest in assets in this space and may accelerate large manufacturers’ interest in smaller, more “natural” food brands across categories. The financial uncertainty associated with an economic downturn is increasing consumer focus on value, leading some consumers to switch to private- label or value-oriented products. As companies look to protect category market share, they may consider acquiring value brands that help insulate them from a shift to private label. This time of crisis has also led consumers to return to big brands they know and trust. While large consumer goods manufacturers represented ~50% of sales in 2018, they accounted for only 16 percent of growth in 2015–2018, that share of growth rose to 39 percent in 2018–2019 and reached 55 percent in the first three weeks of  April 2020.2 This new strength will support large traditional manufacturers’ pursuit of smaller brands that may not enjoy such tailwinds as a result of the crisis. Larger manufacturers may reassess their strategy for slower-growing heritage brands. They may take the opportunity to divest noncore heritage brands at more attractive valuations or allocate investment to foster innovation and growth of their heritage brands. COVID-19’s demand shocks have increased the importance of supply chain resilience as  retailers actively manage product availability. This challenge has laid bare the shortcomings of smaller producers 2 Nielsen, nielsen.com. (52 weeks ending June 16, 2019) – (52 weeks, ending June 20, 2015); (52 weeks, ending June 15, 2019) – (52 weeks, ending June 16, 2018); seven weeks ending April 18, 2020. that depend heavily on co-manufacturing. Large producers may look to purchase smaller challenger brands at lower valuations and/or shore up supply control though additional vertical integration. Increased e-commerce penetration and in-home consumption likely will increase interest in digital and last-mile delivery capabilities across large manufacturers, leading large producers to participate in emerging ecosystems and seek acquisitions in data and analytics or last-mile delivery. Evolution of Consumer Goods M&A deal archetypes post-crisis As companies continue to navigate the crisis in the coming months, their focus on the health of employees, customers, and consumers and on financial resilience will remain paramount. After addressing these core issues, their focus will shift to emerging from the crisis stronger and to reimagining their businesses. We expect today’s trends to encourage companies to undertake a holistic evaluation of their strategic ambitions, business models, categories, and brands. As part of this re-evaluation, some companies will identify a role for M&A in their portfolios, which may mean acquisitions to pursue inorganic growth or divestitures to fuel growth elsewhere. M&A decisions, as always, will be company-specific, as a deal that’s right for one company (for example, buying a challenger brand at a potentially lower multiple than last year) may not be the right deal for another. Financial stability, multiyear strategic direction, product and brand portfolios, and pre- crisis positions will all be important factors for companies to consider. The key for companies will be to take the time required to think about M&A strategy before rushing into deals. Finding the right asset is preferable to getting the wrong one at a lower cost than usual. For consumer goods companies for which M&A can jump-start a new journey or course-correct a current one, we see multiple possibilities for each of the deal archetypes to propel growth—as well as the need in some cases for divestitures. 4 The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A Expanding the portfolio. First and foremost, scale will matter again. Across categories, retailers will have more confidence in the supply chains of larger manufacturers; big brands are again winning consumers’ trust; and products from scaled consumer goods companies will be more readily available. While driven in part by COVID-19, the re-emergence of household brand names and growth in large manufacturers’ portfolios were already happening before the crisis.3 While scale is coming back, it has changed. New types of scale in the form of data, platforms, and advanced analytics capabilities will provide a competitive edge in the future. As companies look to secure such scale, they will need to consider a wider range of partnerships. With the right timing, companies with healthy balance sheets and debt ratios will find opportunities to acquire long-desired assets at a discount. Furthermore, deals to expand the portfolio are the clearest winners in reducing per-unit costs across the portfolio. Company executives will need to look seriously at the value of increased resiliency and ask how long the window of opportunity to shape their portfolio, while realizing incremental value, will last. Recent shifts in market sentiment demonstrate how quickly opportunities can disappear. Large manufacturers with some combination of relatively low leverage, access to investment- grade debt, and a cash-heavy balance sheet will be particularly well positioned to capitalize on this deal archetype. They will, however, likely need to navigate increased scrutiny from shareholders on the size of synergies that can be achieved. Snapping up challengers and acquiring capabilities. We believe that consumer trends will encourage companies to use M&A to bolster their capabilities and build their next normal business model. While growth is likely to be tempered for some challenger brands, the original premise that made them attractive to large consumer goods companies still holds—bringing larger companies new capabilities, loyal fan bases, and innovative products. The crisis has highlighted the structural disadvantages that many challengers face. Heavily co-manufactured supply chains mean less control over shifting production in a crisis, and smaller balance sheets highlight the cash-flow issues associated with highly variable demand. Both can cause retailers to prefer larger brands with greater supply reliability. Furthermore, large manufacturers have invested heavily in digital capabilities to close some of the gaps with their smaller peers. These dynamics will likely depress the valuations for many challenger brands and provide an opportunity for larger companies to build capabilities through acquisitions and/or partnerships. The challenger-related M&A activity that we expect to see will probably mix partnerships and acquisitions. Some deals in this archetype have proceeded through COVID-19 (for example, Nestle Purina’s acquisition of Lily’s Kitchen,4 Puig’s acquisition of Charlotte Tilbury5), and many of these smaller companies’ attributes that attracted larger manufacturers in the first place remain—leading digital engagement capabilities and extremely loyal consumer bases (such as with Glossier) or e-commerce-related go-to-market advantages (such as with Pharmapacks). The shift to e-commerce, greater reliance on digital marketing, increased importance of ingredient transparency, decline in the food-service channel, and the critical role of last-mile delivery all suggest the need for stronger digital connectivity between consumers and manufacturers and emphasize the importance of e-commerce capabilities. Consumer goods companies will have to answer several questions about building tomorrow’s 3 Nielsen, nielsen.com. (52 weeks ending June 16, 2019) – (52 weeks, ending June 20, 2015); (52 weeks, ending June 15, 2019) – (52 weeks, ending June 16, 2018); seven weeks ending April 18, 2020. 4 “Nestle’s Purina PetCare acquires natural pet-food brand Lily’s Kitchen,” Nestle, April 1, 2020,  nestle.com. 5 Aaron Kirchfeld and Dinesh Nair, “Spain Perfume firm buys makeup brand Charlotte Tilbury,” Bloomberg, June 4, 2020, bloomberg.com. 5 The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A capabilities today. What downstream partnerships can you forge that will give you an advantage as e-commerce gains importance? What data, analytics, and digital marketing capabilities should you invest in and how? How can you boost your e-commerce capabilities quickly? What distribution or last-mile delivery investments should you make? What should you bring in-house to better prepare you to manage this new ecosystem? Our past research indicates that a programmatic approach to snapping up challengers and building capabilities yields the best outcomes of the three deal archetypes. We believe that consumer goods companies at the forefront of acquiring and/or partnering with disrupters will likewise win down the line. Betting on adjacencies. This is the hardest archetype for consistently extracting value, as these deals generate the lowest median TSR. Post-crisis, we expect most companies to hunker down and focus on their core business. However, it is helpful to distinguish between horizontal adjacencies (that is, primarily diversifying into altogether different businesses or categories) and vertical adjacencies (that is, making acquisitions up or down the value chain). Companies with the means and intent to pursue a portfolio diversification strategy will find the opportunity less expensive in a time of depressed but varied valuations. The impact of COVID-19 and the lack of resiliency it has exposed in some consumer sectors may increase the need for diversification. In addition, the divergence in valuations across sub-sectors may make equity financing of some adjacent deals more attractive. Consumer goods companies with heavily co-manufactured supply chains may look to increase long-term resiliency by integrating upstream with critical suppliers. The crisis is highlighting the value of direct control, and some reduction in efficiency may prove an acceptable trade-off. Owning these assets may also support longer-term strategies to satisfy consumer preferences like sustainability. Some suppliers may require a cash infusion or outright purchase to survive. The downstream disruptions caused by COVID-19 and shifts in channel consumption habits will require consumer goods companies to think more broadly about how they engage their downstream partners. Partnerships with traditional retailers, food-service companies, distributors, and online delivery platforms (including logistics) likely will need to evolve in line with long-term industry trends. As companies look forward to the next normal and reassess the role of M&A in their post-crisis corporate strategies, several questions can help them rethink their M&A strategies (Exhibit 3). Private equity. As PE players shift from managing their current portfolios in the crisis to looking for investments, we expect the role of PE funds in Consumer Goods M&A to evolve. The current climate of uncertainty, state of the leveraged loan markets, and more limited ability to realize synergies (unless executing a buy-and-build approach) are likely to make would-be financial investors approach valuations cautiously. However, the global PE industry has an estimated $1.7 trillion in dry powder,6 and some players have indicated that they see the current situation as an opportunity to invest in traditionally inaccessible companies and brands.7 Furthermore, those who invested in consumer goods companies during the GFC saw slightly higher median exit multiples than in the prior or the following two years (Exhibit 4). The financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis (for example, depressed multiples, scarcity of capital), coupled with the revival of large brands, provides the right conditions for PE investors to play a significant role in consumer goods deals, including in carve-outs of noncore assets, an area that has historically been of great interest to PE firms. 6 Preqin, May 13, 2020, https://www.preqin.com/insights/2020 7 K. Wiggins and M. Vandevelde, Financial Times, April 6, 2020 https://www.ft.com/stream/ab70c42c-4d60-4851-89bb- 16e2daeddfc1 6 The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A Exhibit 3 Divestitures. By and large, we expect most consumer goods companies to weather the crisis well. That said, some distressed companies will need cash to secure business continuity and strengthen their balance sheets, and many companies were already conducting strategic reviews of their portfolios before the crisis. COVID-19 provides fresh impetus for portfolio review, as companies will be able to compare how different brands performed in a unique period of demand fluctuation and see which brands did and did not benefit from increases in category demand. loomed in 2008, the most resilient companies divested underperforming businesses faster than their peers and reduced debt by about one dollar for every dollar of capital on their balance sheets, while less resilient competitors added more than three dollars of debt.8 TSR performance indicates that shareholders reward companies that take an activist mindset and use divestitures to dynamically manage their portfolio. Analysis from 2007–2017 indicates that companies that refreshed their revenue source by 10 to 30 percent outperformed those that did not on TSR by approximately four percentage points9 Some otherwise well-performing companies will use this opportunity to carve out and sell underperforming businesses, or businesses that do not align with their portfolio strategies, to free up cash and invest in growth.

We encourage consumer goods companies to take three steps now as they contemplate M&A and partnerships going forward, all grounded in the three Cs of excellent M&A strategy—competitive advantage, capacity (financial and operational), and conviction. Define the next normal—and where your competitive advantage lies. The first step in redefining M&A and partnership strategy is understanding what the next normal means for your company. The new reality will depend largely on the lasting impact of COVID-19 on your core consumer segments, including their behaviors and spending habits. Where are the growth opportunities today, and where will they be tomorrow? Where are consumers spending money—in which categories and channels? How have their tastes, preferences, and concerns changed, creating new opportunities for differentiation? In this context, how have your competitive advantages changed, and what new advantages have emerged? How can M&A and partnerships accelerate your growth? Assess your capacity to execute acquisitions and partnerships. A realistic assessment of balance sheet strength and your ability to make acquisitions independently, as well as your ability to secure financing in the post-crisis environment, will provide the critical foundation for your M&A strategy. Assessing the willingness of existing shareholders to accept dilution for attractive equity deals will also play a key role. Determining feasible acquisition targets will lay the foundation for prioritizing exploratory actions. Build conviction with early exploratory actions in the M&A market. Consumer goods companies should generate data-supported perspectives on market trajectory, next normal scenarios post-crisis, and the risks of further disruption. Short-listing top priorities and securing executive and Board commitment to M&A will accelerate decision- making as markets thaw and potential targets emerge. 8 The next normal in consumer: Implications for Consumer Goods M&A Harris Atmar is an associate partner in McKinsey’s New Jersey office; Sara Hudson is a partner in the London office; Anish M&A due diligence during the crisis Koshy is an associate partner in the Chicago office; Stefan Rickert is a partner in the Hamburg office; Rodrigo Slelatt is a partner in the Miami office.

text = "Consumer Packaged Goods Practice The next wave of consumer M&A: Searching for growth M&A has become more difficult of late. Consumer-goods companies need to rediscover why acquisitions succeed. by Susan Nolen Foushee, Ed Little, Niall Murphy, Amaury Saint Olive, and Kandarp Shah October 2019 © pixhook/Getty Images For the past 60 years or more, the consumer- goods industry has used a trusted model to grow and create value. Briefly, that model includes four elements for organic growth: brands with mass appeal, privileged trade relationships with large retailers, new ventures in developing markets, and a consistent operating model to reduce costs. M&A can supplement and accelerate organic growth by adding new brands to mighty marketing and manufacturing capabilities.1 Today, however, growth is hard to come by, and the largest companies are encountering the stiffest headwinds. From 2013 to 2017, their real-organic- growth rate barely rose, by 1.7 percent annually, even as real GDP growth in their markets averaged 2.8 percent. It isn’t hard to find reasons why the behemoths are having trouble generating growth in their massive portfolios. Consumer preferences, especially those of millennials and Gen Zers, are shifting rapidly, and big companies are slower to respond than their nimbler, digitally savvy rivals are. Barriers to entry have come down, and newcomers find it easier to gain access to the shelf and to consumers—and they can outsource their manufacturing and supply-chain needs. Emerging brands that can use labels such as “craft,” “local,” and “authentic”—with the accompanying premium prices—evoke envy from incumbents and are proving to be worthy competitors. The longtime accelerator of growth, M&A, has also become much harder. Acquisition multiples in consumer-goods companies have pushed higher: in six of the past eight years, earnings multiples have exceeded the longer-term (11-year) average. That’s symptomatic of greatly increased competition for deals, especially from the private-equity sector: financial buyers (including both buyout and venture- capital firms) accounted for 16 percent of total value in 2015–18, up from 10 percent a decade earlier. Buyout fundraising has soared to roughly $400 billion, on average, in each of the past five years. “Dry powder” in buyout firms has reached a record high of around $1.2 trillion. Despite all the available capital, a combination of higher multiples and a perceived lack of attractive assets has kept deal volumes down. In 2007, more than 2,300 consumer-goods companies were acquired. In 2018, that number fell to fewer than 1,800, and it’s now in line with the level of deal activity typical of the first years of the century. Nor have these deals always met expectations. Some large, headline-grabbing deals have disappointed: after capturing cost synergies, they ceased to contribute to long-term growth. As the mix of M&A targets shifted to feature more “challenger” brands (fast-growing new companies in the acquirer’s core categories), many incumbents purchased smaller targets in an unsystematic way and without enough scale to generate any momentum in their portfolios. With both organic growth and M&A sputtering, industry performance has slid. From 2006 to 2011, total shareholder returns (TSR) of large, US-focused consumer-goods companies outpaced the S&P 500 by 6 percent. But from 2011 to mid-2019, these same companies underperformed the S&P 500 by around 3 percent a year. Companies are on the hunt for a new model for consumer goods in which M&A will be a vital part of a resurgence of growth. But to find success, companies need to return to M&A fundamentals. In this article, we review our new research as it illuminates the results of recent M&A activities, shows how some companies have found success, and informs two of the three essential tasks for companies that want to improve their M&A work: figuring out what companies to buy (short answer: challenger brands) and how to buy them (programmatically, rather than ad hoc). (For information on how to integrate acquisitions, the third perennial question, see “The next wave of consumer M&A: Executing for value” on McKinsey.com.) 1 Greg Kelly, Udo Kopka, Jörn Küpper, and Jessica Moulton, “The new model for consumer goods,” April 2018, McKinsey.com. 2 The next wave of consumer M&A: Searching for growth Article type and Year Article Title Exhibit X of X Exhibit 1 The programmatic approach to M&A outperformed other approaches by consumer-goods companies. Total shareholder returns by M&A program, compound annual growth rate 2013–18, % 6.4 4.5 Median 4.3 (n = 119 companies) 0.2 Large deal Programmatic Selective 33 29 57 Number of companies Winning M&A To explore how inorganic growth can be a platform for success, we studied the M&A records of 119 consumer-goods companies around the world; collectively, they acquired about 1,040 companies during 2013–18.2 The research identified insights into the companies and deals that have done well in recent years.3 Thirty percent of the most successful acquirers use a programmatic4 approach to M&A, compared with 10 percent of the least successful companies. The least successful acquirers tend to invest sporadically, jumping on deals that seem attractive, then retreating to the sidelines. And many of the least successful acquirers show a penchant for one-off big deals. By contrast, we see better returns for programmatic buyers whose dedicated teams follow a sequence of carefully chosen practices and behaviors, including disciplined approaches to target selection, valuation, and negotiation. Programmatic buyers generated 6.4 percent annual TSR, while large-deal buyers and selective buyers produced 0.2 percent and 4.5 percent TSR, respectively (Exhibit 1). What to buy: The search for growth in an overpriced world In addition to looking at deal programs, we analyzed the types of companies that acquirers go after and found further lessons for success. In the quest to find value and portfolio momentum, consumer-goods companies have sometimes leaped into deals and found neither. Our research suggests a threefold mantra for acquirers: buy into companies and sectors that you know well; even better, buy faster-growing challengers; and go beyond your core competence into adjacent sectors only if necessary.5 Take the last point first. Shifts into adjacent markets were infrequent in our data set (nine of 119 companies primarily used M&A to expand into adjacencies)—and for good reason. In our research, companies that chose to “go with what you know” produced 3.3 percent TSR, while adjacent acquirers managed only 0.4 percent. Lower-performing companies sometimes made adjacent deals, perhaps reflecting their performance pressure. Fundamentally, the move into an adjacent sector must be part of a strategy large enough to shift the needle, 2 Analysis based on 119 public consumer-goods companies headquartered in the Americas, Asia–Pacific (Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea), or Europe. 3 Our colleagues have recently conducted an overview of global M&A, using a dataset of 2000 companies. See Jeff Rudnicki, Kate Siegel, and Andy West, “How lots of small deals add up to big value,” McKinsey Quarterly, July 2019, McKinsey.com.  Our research encompasses a larger number of branded consumer products companies with market cap exceeding $300 million.  It excludes companies in emerging Asia, as we have focused on M&A trends in developed markets.  And given the meaningful changes in growth and customer behavior in the past five years, we have focused our analysis on 2013–2018 results. 4 Programmatic buyers did two or more small or midsize deals per year. Large-deal buyers made one or more acquisitions during the five years studied in which the purchase price represented 30 percent or more of their own market caps. Selective buyers did fewer than two deals per year. 5 We divided acquirers into three categories based on their approach. “Expanding the portfolio” primarily involved acquisition of brands in the acquirer’s core categories, often from direct competitors, largely in an effort to build scale. “Snapping up challengers” primarily involved the acquisition of up-and-coming brands in the acquirer’s core categories; challengers typically have strong growth prospects. “Betting on adjacencies” primarily involved entering or expanding in categories beyond the core to access new consumers or product segments in a bid to diversify the portfolio and boost growth. 3 The next wave of consumer M&A: Searching for growth as General Mills did when it bought Blue Buffalo; its sale of Green Giant also helped tilt the portfolio mix. Target companies prefer acquirers that can offer distinctive synergies, resources, or capabilities (such as access to Bel’s international markets for MOM). Challenger brands to the fore Looking more closely at the much larger group of portfolio expanders, we found an intriguing result. The 88 acquirers that primarily bought assets or companies similar to their own produced 3.3 percent TSR. But the 22 companies that focused on challenger brands did much better, producing 6.3 percent TSR. Small consumer-goods brands have exploded recently, helped by venture-capital firms and their astonishing $7.2 billion investment in the past four years. Companies like Beyond Meat, Califia Farms, Caulipower, Hello Beverages, Impossible Foods, Kite Hill, Unreal Brands, and many others are setting the pace and have earned the title of legitimate challengers to the incumbents.6 However, acquisitions of challenger brands aren’t a panacea. Their valuations often embed high growth rates. We examined transactions across categories in which enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization multiples exceeded 20. And, in more than a few cases, we found that for such multiples to pay off, the acquired company would have to generate sustainable growth two times faster than the category. That said, if acquirers can pull multiple levers to generate value, even these expensive acquisitions can be worthwhile. Portfolio-expansion deals are the most common by measures of both volume and value, except in the beauty and personal-care sectors. Such deals drive value through greater scale, often anchored in operational and overhead synergies. As advantages of scale have eroded and target companies are increasingly lean from extensive cost cutting, extracting value from these deals has become more challenging. Nor do portfolio expansions address the growth challenge consumer-goods companies are facing. In our research, we found that only half of these companies outperformed median TSR of the total sample set (Exhibit 2). For portfolio-expansion deals to be successful, acquirers must identify significantly greater potential for synergies beyond typical scale. We found a few examples that appeared to do so. Campbell Soup’s acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance strengthened its position in snacking. And Ferrero Group acquired Nestlé USA’s confectionery business to gain access to strong legacy brands it could revitalize, and to manufacturing and distribution in the United States. It’s what you give, not what you get In the search for growth within the portfolio, the focus for many companies will likely be on challenger brands. But which ones? Leading companies identify organizations for which they can be the best, most natural owners, understanding that the goal isn’t to “harvest” the target but rather to bring additional capabilities or assets to bear that can steepen its growth curve and broaden market access. Incumbents often have mature and well-resourced capabilities across the value chain, notably in long-established distribution channels, at-scale manufacturing, deeper innovation budgets, and sophisticated trade and pricing management. Using these assets can shift the growth trajectory of a target and possibly justify high valuations above and beyond cost synergies. The combination of an incumbent’s capabilities and a target’s fast-growing products can support an investment thesis built on momentum. Consider distribution. In the US beverage industry, a few national companies have distribution systems that can lift challenger brands (such as craft producers or health and wellness brands) to new levels of growth. Coca-Cola has enjoyed success with the Honest Tea brand, providing national distribution, fueling innovation, and ultimately expanding the brand into a household name that straddles across categories.

In beauty, Estée Lauder has achieved continuous dynamic growth by adding several brands with strong appeal to younger customers and offering them its repositioned distribution system, after it pivoted from department stores to booming specialty retailers. The company has described M&A as a “high priority” and has used its distribution skills (especially in emerging markets and travel retail) and traditional marketing to turn several small and medium-size brands into global champions. Estée Lauder is a true programmatic acquirer, with a record of close to 15 deals in the past decade and ten in the past five years. 5 The next wave of consumer M&A: Searching for growth How to buy: Flexing the M&A muscle In July 2019, our colleagues updated  McKinsey’s long-running research into the value of programmatic M&A. They confirmed two trends first seen in the early 2000s. First, a program of many deals is much more successful than other approaches. Companies using a programmatic approach delivered slightly more TSR than sector averages. Over time, the programmatic approach to M&A becomes ever more critical for growth. Of the 1,000 companies that remained in the top 100 during the entire period studied (2007–17), 60 percent used active M&A programs. Second, the research found that the “big bang” approach (in which companies make infrequent, large deals) had the worst TSR performance versus a broader index. The beat goes on Our research on the past five years confirms the relevance of both findings to consumer-goods companies. First, as shown in Exhibit 1, while some companies in each profile (programmatic, selective, and large deal) did well, the programmatic buyers continue to have the greatest success. The long- running trend here is that M&A is a muscle that must be built and exercised regularly. Second, consumer-goods companies whose M&A emphasized the megadeal returned a meager 0.2 percent TSR from 2013 to 2018. It’s evident that many of the largest deals in recent years have been primarily about cost savings rather than growth. And several have successfully chopped expenses. But there is a natural limit to cost reduction; if a deal doesn’t also include new combinations of assets and capabilities that can stimulate growth, its returns will be capped. Of 33 companies that conducted large deals (in which the purchase price represented more than 30 percent of the acquirer’s market cap) during 2013–18, 14 had a one-year TSR of negative 5 percent or lower. Some deals saw significant write-downs of the acquired companies’ values in subsequent years as well. In a way, the market may be correcting for this. We expect that large deals based on cost synergies will become harder to find because of industry consolidation and the efforts that many consumer- goods companies are making to cut costs. And in those deals that do take place, cost synergies will become harder to realize. How programmatic M&A works Programmatic M&A also features prominently in McKinsey’s research on economic profit and industry structure: it’s one of the handful of strategic moves that can lift a company from an also-ran to an industry leader. What differentiates programmatic acquirers? We believe there are four main skills: 1.  Be strategic. The primary strategic need for consumer-goods companies is growth. M&A has to support that strategy; it is a means, not an end. Winners use M&A to complement and reshape their portfolios; they don’t let M&A dictate corporate direction. Rather, M&A is a part of an agile approach to dynamic resource allocation. 2.  Be proactive in identification and selection. Prolific deal makers cultivate a broad range of relationships to increase deal flow and to help avoid costly auctions. They identify disruptive brands before others do, by attending trade shows, scanning social media, and collecting consumer research. Dialogue between the business and the business-development team is essential. 3.  Practice deal discipline. This rings true across sectors but is especially meaningful for consumer-goods incumbents pursuing highly valued challenger brands. High growth rates and distribution gains ultimately face gravity. Small brands often benefit from both forces; once full distribution is reached, growth will slow.  Successful acquirers walk away when valuations cannot be supported and sufficient value cannot be created. 4.  Adapt the integration approach to the target. While integration fundamentals—a sharp focus on value creation, robust preparation, and rigorous execution—remain the same, new best practices are emerging for each deal type.7 7 For more, see Anish Koshy, Rocky Lipsky, Stefan Rickert, Rodrigo Slelatt, and Kristi Weaver, “The next wave of consumer M&A: Executing for value,” October 2019, McKinsey.com. 6 The next wave of consumer M&A: Searching for growth Constellation Brands, a leading US-based beer, wine, and spirits manufacturer, modeled these characteristics as its TSR grew by double digits annually over the past five years. The company used a programmatic approach to M&A to adapt its portfolio continually, entering or building scale in the fastest- growing categories while divesting or discontinuing lower-cost and underperforming brands. It made more than ten acquisitions and divestitures during this period. As the company’s CFO said, “So everything that is not a ‘power brand,’ you can assume that we’re either going to sell it, discontinue it, or milk it very quickly over the next year or so.”8 As the evidence shows, M&A remains integral to growth in consumer goods. But with deal markets growing more challenging, companies must raise their acquisition game while bearing in mind three rules: go with what you know, buy faster-growing challengers, and go beyond your core competence into adjacent sectors only if necessary.

text = """ECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR JAPAN Japan’s Revised SNA Changed Recent Records of GDP Level By Nobuo Iizuka Author Nobuo Iizuka What Is the SNA? The Systems of National Accounts (SNA) is a system to record the overall picture of the state of the economy of a nation systematically in a manner that allows international comparisons. The most closely watched indicator is GDP. This indicates the gross amount of added value that a country produces, and per capita GDP is often used as an indicator to compare a country’s wealth internationally. GDP  is  created  by  processing  various  economic  statistics.  The timing  of  when  individual  economic  statistics  become  available varies, and therefore GDP is released and revised several times. The 1st  Preliminary  Estimate  of  Japanese  GDP  is  released  about  one month  after  a  particular  quarter  ends,  and  about  two  months  later the  2nd  Preliminary  Estimate  is  released.  The  Annual  Estimates  of GDP are then released roughly nine months after the particular fiscal year ends. For example, the 1st Preliminary Estimates for the third quarter  of  2016  was  released  on  Nov.  14  and  the  2nd  Preliminary Estimate  on  Dec.  8.  The  Annual  Estimates  of  GDP  for  2015  were released between December 2016 and January 2017. Questioning Reliability of GDP There has been a recent surge in views questioning the reliability of Japan’s GDP. In December 2015, the 2nd Preliminary Estimate for Japan’s real GDP growth rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was announced  to  be  an  annualized  1.0%,  and  because  this  showed  a significant upward revision from the negative 0.8% as released in the 1st Preliminary Estimate, there was wide coverage in the media. In addition,  Bank  of  Japan  staff  published  a  paper  in  July  2016  that noted there was a possibility that Japan’s real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2014 may have been positive. The Annual Estimates of GDP for fiscal  2014  which  were  released  in  December  2015  confirmed  a negative real GDP growth rate for Japan of 1.0%. These  arguments  highlight  the  challenges  Japan  faces  in estimating its GDP. The current GDP estimations consolidate supply- side  statistics  such  as  production  and  demand-side  statistics  from surveys of entities engaging in consumption and investments. One of the aims of this is to create preliminary estimates. Before the current system,  preliminary  estimates  of  GDP  were  announced  around  the time the current 2nd Preliminary Estimate is released, and this was strongly  criticized  for  being  too  late  for  making  comparisons  with other countries. The main reason was that the demand-side statistics of  capital  investment  in  the  “Financial  Statements  Statistics  of Corporations  by  Industry”  (Ministry  of  Finance)  were  not  released until two months after the quarter had ended. By using supply-side statistics,  the  1st  Preliminary  Estimate  is  now  released  a  month earlier  than  before.  On  the  other  hand,  “Financial  Statements Statistics  of  Corporations  by  Industry”  are  required  for  the  2nd Preliminary Estimate, and therefore it is inevitable that revisions will be made from the 1st to the 2nd Preliminary Estimate. According  to  my  revision  study  for  the  52  quarters  between  the second quarter of 2002, when the current estimations began, and the first  quarter  of  2015,  the  average  revised  range  for  the  real  GDP growth rate between the 1st and 2nd Preliminary Estimate is almost zero. There have been both positive revisions and negative revisions, but  on  average  it  is  zero.  But  in  identifying  the  average  for  each quarter,  the  first  quarter  shows  significant  positive  revisions  while the third quarter shows negative revisions. Moreover, the average of the absolute value of the revision range is 0.8 points on an annual basis. This is not a small revision range for the Japanese economy which  suffers  from  a  low  growth  rate  around  less  than  1%  on  an annual average. Economic Activities Not Captured by GDP One  way  to  minimize  the  revision  between  the  1st  and  the  2nd Preliminary  Estimate  is  to  conduct  the  GDP  estimates  around  the supply-side  statistics.  It  may  even  allow  the  release  to  come  out earlier. For example, the United Kingdom’s GDP, whose estimates are based on supply-side statistics, is released within a month of the end of a particular quarter, and the revision range is relatively small. But the  paper  by  the  BOJ  staff  points  out  that  this  may  not  be  able  to 62   Japan SPOTLIGHT • January / February 2017 CHART Trend in GDP capture  the  added  value  that  has  been created. GDP  can  be  captured  from  three angles:  production,  income,  and expenditure. The production side of GDP is  defined  to  be  Output  minus  Input. Japanese  production  GDP  is  calculated using  the  supply-side  statistics  of  the Annual  Report  on  National  Accounts, and  the  income  side  of  GDP  is  thought to be equivalent to this figure. The paper b y  t h e  B O J  s t a f f  e s t i m a t e s  t h e breakdown  of  income-side  GDP  using taxation  data,  and  points  to  the possibility that the real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2014 may have been 2.4%. Of course, the estimations by the BOJ staff may have a margin of error, but the paper  highlighted  the  importance  of multidimensional  observations  in capturing  economic  activities.  For example, the United States also releases the  growth  rate  of  gross  domestic income (GDI) which captures the growth in income in addition to the GDP growth rate, and the average for both rates is also indicated. Increase in GDP with Introduction of 2008 SNA The  2nd  Preliminary  Estimate  for  the  third  quarter  of  2016  was released  on  Dec.  8.  The  real  GDP  growth  rate  was  an  annualized 1.3%, revised from the 2.2% in the 1st Preliminary Estimate. What changed even more than the current growth rate were the past actual figures. Nominal GDP for 2015 was 530.5 trillion yen, and this has increased  by  31  trillion  yen  from  the  499.3  trillion  yen  of  the  1st Preliminary Estimate (Chart). For periods before 2014, nominal GDP increased  roughly  by  between  6  trillion  yen  and  27  trillion  yen  per year.  On  the  other  hand,  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  for  2015  was 1.2%,  revised  from  the  0.6%  in  the  1st  Preliminary  Estimate.  The average  annual  growth  rate  from  1994  to  2015  was  0.9%,  revised from the 0.8% in the 1st Preliminary Estimate. These  significant  revisions  began  with  Japan’s  GDP  introducing 2008 SNA (it used to be 1993 SNA). The 2008 SNA, the latest edition of the international standards, was adopted by the United Nations in January  2009.  The  2008  SNA  has  several  features  and  the  main reason for the increase in GDP is the capitalization of research and development  (R&D).  In  the  1993  SNA,  expenditure  on  R&D  was treated as intermediate consumption, so it was not included in GDP. In  the  2008  SNA,  it  is  treated  as  gross  fixed  capital  formation. Note: The “old” data was released on Nov. 14, 2016 and “new” data on Dec. 8, 2016. Source: SNA (National Accounts of Japan), Cabinet Office According to a document released by the Cabinet Office on Sept. 15, 2016, with the introduction of the 2008 SNA, nominal GDP for 2011 increased by roughly 20 trillion yen, of which roughly 17 trillion yen resulted from the capitalization of R&D. Benchmark Year Changed to 2011 From  the  actual  figures  released  from  Dec.  8  onwards,  the benchmark year for GDP will be changed to 2011 (it was previously 2005). The Input-Output Table used to estimate GDP will also change to the one for 2011 and the latest results of the Population Census will also be incorporated. Real GDP for 2011 is regarded as equal to nominal GDP, and therefore the standard for real GDP also changes. Changes to the past actual figures also reflect the revisions made to the benchmark year. Close  monitoring  of  how  the  revision  patterns  will  change  for Japanese GDP with the introduction of the 2008 SNA and the change in benchmark year will be essential.

text = """Executive Insights Volume XIX, Issue 69 Why Medicare Advantage Is Marching Toward 70% Penetration Through over-reimbursement and under- reimbursement, Medicare Advantage — the first real “retail” health insurance market of scale — has consistently penetrated the Medicare marketplace over the past 20 years. And it shows no sign of slowing down. For payers, that means finding ways to drive growth of their Medicare Advantage offering. For providers not already contracting with Medicare Advantage, it’s time to bite the bullet and either figure out an effective business model or consider launching their own plan. For investors, this is a macro trend and as such, a long-term opportunity. To be sure, the penetration rise has been measured at just 1.5 percentage points per year over the past 10 years. But accounting for recent trend and other market dynamics, L.E.K. Consulting’s proprietary county-level projection model shows Medicare Advantage enrollment rising from roughly 20 million, or 35% penetration, at the end of 2017 to approximately 38 million, or 50% penetration, by the end of 2025. Nor will it stop there. Indeed, we believe that Medicare Advantage’s march forward will continue apace until its penetration rate hits 70%.

Consulting’s Healthcare Services practice. For more information, contact healthcare@lek.com. Executive Insights Driving the march Medicare Advantage is one of the rare products in the U.S. healthcare system that not only satisfies the “triple aim” of healthcare improvement — that is, improving the experience of care and the health of populations while reducing per capita healthcare costs — but also appeals to the self-interests of three very powerful constituents that have been driving its march forward: consumers, health plans and the government. •  Consumers like Medicare Advantage plans because they offer predictability, additional benefits, care coordination and lower estimated total annual healthcare costs than are offered by either Original Medicare or Medicare Supplement plan options (see Figure 1) •   Health plans like Medicare Advantage plans because they make more money: Medicare Advantage plans yield higher nominal revenue and operating margin with per-member per-month (PMPM) revenue of $800-$1,200 and operating margin of $30-$60 PMPM vs. $180-$220 and $10-$18 for Medicare Supplement, respectively •  Government supports Medicare Advantage because it enables the effective deployment of cost trend management tools other than the fee schedule Slow and steady growth Over the past 20 years, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has grown at a slow but steady pace (see Figure 2). The sole aberration in consistent growth occurred between 1999 and 2002, when the Balanced Budget Act led to the loss of Medicare Advantage plan options for some 20% of the covered population. As a result, the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries with access to a Medicare Advantage plan — then known as Medicare+Choice — fell from 72% in 1999 to 61% in 2002. Enrollment dropped 21%. As soon as access was restored by way of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, penetration quickly reverted back to the trend line. Indeed, even the reimbursement cuts that resulted from the Affordable Care Act — which reduced average Medicare Advantage reimbursement from underlying fee-for-service costs plus 12% in 2011 to parity with underlying fee-for-service costs by 20171 — have not impacted the steady growth. Headed for 70% penetration We expect Medicare Advantage to continue its slow but steady growth, reaching 60% to 70% penetration sometime between 2030 and 2040. We base our forecast on a number of factors, among which are that several urban and rural counties not only have already achieved a Medicare Advantage penetration rate of 55%-65%, but their penetration rates continue to grow at a weighted- average 1.0 percentage point per year (see Figure 3).

Much of it will come from Original Medicare, which could decrease more than 20 points, from 40% to 10%-20% penetration (see Figure 4). Seniors with Original Medicare will likely find their 20% coinsurance responsibility more burdensome as healthcare expenses continue to increase. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, expenditures for physician and other professional services increased approximately 5.4% per year from 2000 to 2014, while expenditures on prescription drugs and other medical nondurables increased 6.2% per year. If healthcare costs continue to increase, a senior on Original Medicare could be responsible for significantly increased out-of-pocket spend. Ongoing increases in age-related chronic conditions will likely convince seniors and soon-to-be seniors that they need the degree of care management Medicare Advantage plans provide. The number of seniors with multiple chronic conditions increased by approximately eight percentage points from 2000 to 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, United Health Foundation notes that the population about to turn 65 is seven percentage points more likely to be obese and six percentage points more likely to have diabetes than those who turned 65 in 1999. L.E.K. conducted a proprietary study and found that roughly 20% of seniors exhibit behavioral factors that would suggest that a Medicare Advantage plan would be their best-fit product; however, they end up defaulting to Original Medicare. These seniors exhibit “concerned but uninformed” tendencies — in other words, they are often worried about their health but aren’t proactive about seeking health or plan information. As such, they are likely to respond positively to outreach and guidance, as they are unlikely to have made a conscious and well-informed decision to remain in Original Medicare (which is why they can also be referred to as “defaulters”). Page 3  L.E.K. Consulting / Executive Insights, Volume XIX, Issue 69 INSIGHTS@WORK® Executive Insights Medicare Advantage vs. Medicare Supplement Meanwhile, the future of Medicare Supplement, which is used to help pay some of the costs that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, is less certain. Medicare Supplement plans face headwinds similar to Original Medicare, such as higher medical costs and an increased desire for care coordination while offering a similar lack of strategic levers to manage healthcare spend. Seniors confronted with increases in premiums could be forced to look elsewhere. Furthermore, a provision in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) bans Medicare Supplement insurers from selling any Medicare Supplement policy that covers the annual Medicare Part B deductible (i.e., first-dollar coverage) to new Medicare enrollees starting January 1, 2020. This impacts Plan C and Plan F offerings, the most popular Medicare Supplement choices today. The MACRA provision was designed to combat notoriously high healthcare utilization of Medicare Supplement members with first-dollar coverage and increase Medicare Supplement purchasers’ “skin in the game.” Analysts outline that the policy could change Medicare Supplement buying behaviors and potentially lead more seniors to choose a Medicare Advantage plan.

Source: L.E.K. analysis Dual eligibles and employer groups As the Medicare Advantage market matures and its relative value proposition becomes clearer, two segments where Medicare Advantage penetration has historically lagged — dual eligibles and employer groups — are rapidly catching up. “Dual eligibles” is a term used to encompass Medicare beneficiaries who also receive Medicaid assistance. Medicare Advantage penetration of dual eligibles, who represent roughly 20% of Medicare eligibles, has lagged MA penetration of overall seniors due to a lack of coordinated state offerings and managed care. However, states are moving aggressively to manage the cost of these high-needs populations. For example, dual demonstration plans are now available in 10 states, fully integrated dual eligible (FIDE) special-needs plans have increased enrollment at 11% per annum since 2012, and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) have increased enrollment programs at 10% per annum since 2012. States with mature dual eligibles managed care programs are also increasingly inclined to move to passive enrollment, which could rapidly accelerate penetration of this segment. Retirees with employer health coverage are another group for whom Medicare Advantage penetration has lagged Medicare Advantage penetration of overall seniors. Approximately 20%-25% of seniors have group retiree coverage from their employer. This population is increasingly expected to join Medicare Advantage as employers transition from retiree drug subsidy (RDS) plans to Medicare Advantage employer group waiver plans (EGWPs) and as employers stop offering group retiree health coverage. Investing in long-term penetration growth Medicare Advantage penetration has grown at a slow but steady pace over the past 25 years. As seniors increasingly eschew Original Medicare in favor of lower payments, better care management and more certainty in costs, with encouragement from both health plans and, albeit indirectly, the government, we expect that growth to continue — to 50% penetration by 2025 and, eventually, all the way to 70%. Page 4  L.E.K. Consulting / Executive Insights, Volume XIX, Issue 69 INSIGHTS@WORK® Executive Insights With that in mind, payers will need to find ways to grow market share of their Medicare Advantage offering — for example, by expanding into new counties, investing in targeted sales to age- ins and adjusting product design to attract new members. And providers that have so far elected not to participate in Medicare Advantage will need to reconsider their stance and figure out a way to win with payers. Some may want to consider whether — and, if so, how — to develop provider-sponsored plans of their own. Investors, meanwhile, should be on the lookout for the vendors poised to support Medicare Advantage’s continued growth — by offering payers superior care management, member engagement, sales and marketing, and other capabilities to boost growth and profitability. Medicare Advantage will soon become the predominant Medicare product offering. It’s time to strike while the iron is hot. 1Source: CMS, Evercore ISI About the Authors Bill Frack is a Managing Director and Partner, and he leads L.E.K.’s Americas Healthcare Services practice.
